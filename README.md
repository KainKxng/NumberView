#NumberView

A simple number tweener.

###What is it?
NumberView is mean to be a take on [Timely][1]'s beatiful and tasteful number tweening animations. Despite looking like it draws actual numbers in it, the numbers drawn are represented as BÃ¨zier curve paths, meticulously calculated with control points and anchors.

###Usage
Using [NumberView][2] to show a single digit in your project is simple. You can drop it into your XML files as a regular custom view:

    <com.deange.numberview.NumberView
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content" />


    final NumberView view = findViewById(...);
    view.advance(1);
    postDelayed(() -> { view.advance(2) }, 1000);
    postDelayed(() -> { view.advance(3) }, 2000);
    ...

However, typically you'll want to show more than one digit at a time. For that you can use [NumberViewGroup][3], which automatically takes care of adding new digits as you need them.

    <com.deange.numberview.NumberViewGroup
            android:layout_height="wrap_content"
            android:layout_width="wrap_content" />


    final NumberViewGroup view = findViewById(...);
    view.advance(1);
    postDelayed(() -> { view.advance(20) }, 1000);
    postDelayed(() -> { view.advance(300) }, 2000);
    ...

You can always view the sample application code for more usage demos.
