###What is it?
NumberView is mean to be a take on [Timely][1]'s beatiful and tasteful number tweening animations. Despite looking like it draws actual numbers in it, the numbers drawn are represented as BÃ¨zier curve paths, meticulously calculated with control points and anchors.

---
###Usage
Using [NumberView][2] in your project is simple. It is a standalone class, no resource files required. It can be added in programatically into your layouts, or be included as a tag in resource files:

```
<com.deange.numberview.NumberView
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content" />
```

---
###Dependencies
No dependencies. Works on all versions of Android, all the way back to 1.0!

###Known Issues

I've seen some lag on the Nexus 5 running on ART. Not sure if this is specific to my device, all Nexus 5s, or ART entirely.

NumberView has a built-in auto-advancing timing system that automatically tweens to the next value, but it isn't a perfect system, since it must be coupled with other view drawing events. It is recommended that you turn off auto-advancing using the `setAutoAdvance(boolean)` method), and manually call `advance()` when necessary. The [Timer][3] class is perfect for this sort of behaviour, especially if you will be using this for any fixed-rate mechanism. See the example activity class for a quick implementation.
